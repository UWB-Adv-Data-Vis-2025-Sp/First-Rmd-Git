## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mpg}
summary(mpg)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r hwympg}
hwydata <- mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarize(mean(hwy))

g <- ggplot(data = hwydata)
g + geom_col(aes(x = `mean(hwy)`, y = manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) +
  ggtitle("Miles per Gallon for Highway Driving by Manufacturer", subtitle = "Data on vehicles from 1999 to 2008 for 38 popular models of cars")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
